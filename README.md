To search the optimum features set using Pearson cor- relation algorithm (PCC) with binary search as well as the sequential forward search algorithm.
To verify the best features set by comparing with other feature selection algorithms on the basis of time, accu- racy and number of features.
To justify the method by comparing the results with the existing approaches.
