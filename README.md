<li>To generate word-based features by analyzing frequently appearing words of emailâ€™s subjects and contents.</li>
<li>To generate link-based features by examining the URL links embedded in an email.</li>
<li>To generate the readability-based features using eight well-known readability algorithms and applying them to discriminate the text contents of phishing emails and legitimate emails.</li>
<li>To search the optimum features set using Pearson cor- relation algorithm (PCC) with binary search as well as the sequential forward search algorithm.</li>
<li>To verify the best features set by comparing with other feature selection algorithms on the basis of time, accu- racy and number of features.</li>
<li>To justify the method by comparing the results with the existing approaches.</li>
